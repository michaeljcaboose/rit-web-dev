            While Hockey and similar sports have been played informally since the 16th century, the first organized
            version of what would become modern Ice Hockey began in Montreal, Canada in the 1870s. The position of
            "Goaltender" would be formalized during this time. Goaltenders were essentially an extra player on the ice,
            with the only extra padding being a glove and a precursor to modern leg pads. Less padding was used because
            players used flat faced wooden sticks, which reduced the speed and elevation of shots. The slapshot also had
            not become popular yet.

            The position wouldn't change much until the 1960s as the snapshot became more popular and players were shooting
            faster and higher than ever before. This is when masks started to appear on the faces of goaltenders around
            the league, and the last goaltender to play in the National Hockey League without a mask played in 1974. All
            padding around the goaltender had been increased, from the legs up to the chest. Thicker gloves were being
            used for catchers, blockers began to morph into their modern "waffle-board" shape, and chest protection began
            to cover the entire upper body rather than only the chest.

            As hockey entered the 1980s, players started to shoot higher and faster shots on goaltenders. For decades,
            goaltenders had utilized a style of play called "Stand-up" where they would remain on their feet to make a
            majority of their saves, usually with their glove hand or by kicking out their legs. This was because most
            shots were low and fast. Hall of Fame players such as Jacque Plante were masters of this style of play during
            the time.

            As the game of hockey changed for skaters, goaltenders needed to adjust to these new shot patterns. The 80s
            and 90s saw goalies transition from "Stand-up" to a style called "Butterfly" where goalies would drop to their
            knees and flair their legs out to cover the bottom of the net. The pioneer of this style in the late 80s and 90s
            was Patrick Roy, who is considered one of the greatest goaltenders of all time.

            As this style became more popular, the gear started changing to fit the style, and eventually players where
            put into two groups: "Butterfly" and "Hybrid", with hybrid being a mixture of the "Stand-up" and "Butterfly"
            styles. All-time great goaltenders such as Dominique Hasek and Martin Brodeur were known to play more of a hybrid
            style, utilizing butterfly techniques while still being flexible in their save selection styles.

            Today, with the speed of the game and the talent and abilities of the skaters shooting on them, goaltenders
            mix and match techniques while being more mobile and athletic than their predecessors. Most goaltenders are
            considered to be hybrid, stopping the pucks any way they can rather than sticking to one concrete style,
            though some goaltenders are notably "butterfly"-only goalies.
