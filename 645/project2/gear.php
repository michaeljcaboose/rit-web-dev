            </figure>
	        <p>The most important piece of equipment a goaltender wears is the mask. 
		        Goaltender masks have come a long way from the old days, where they 
		        weren’t worn full time until around 1959.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			    Modern masks come in many different shapes, sizes, and designs, and are also made with materials that deliver varying levels of durability, weight, and comfort.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			    Elite Masks are usually priced at a minimum of $500 and the price can increase significantly from there depending on materials and customization. These are worn by goaltenders playing at an elite level, such as collegiate, juniors (15+ years old), and minor pros. The shell of the mask will contain Kevlar, Ballistic Lexan, and carbon composite materials, only usually high quality versions of those materials. Cages for these masks are built with high durability materials, titanium being the most frequent base material. Internal padding in elite masks is more comfortable and shock absorbing than the lesser masks.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			    Competitive Masks are around $250 to $500 and provide adequate protection for most goaltenders, from a high school player to a “beer-league” player. They are comparable in some respects to elite masks but have some differences, such as weight, feel, and materials used in construction. These masks are generally made with highly durable fiberglass, but can experience chips or cracks that would otherwise not occur in an elite mask if hit with a hard enough shot. Cages are close in quality to elite level masks, but may not be as rust-resistant or as strong in some circumstances. In most cases they are interchangeable. Padding in comp level masks provide a more comfortable, protective fit than entry level masks but can be heavier and denser than elite level gear.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			    Cheaper masks, around $250 and under, are constructed with cheaper fiberglass or plastic-based compounds. Plastic does not protect as well as composite fiberglass and can be much more susceptible to cracks and breaks. Foam in entry level masks is usually thick and soft comfort foam, and won’t absorb as much shock as padding in higher level masks. These are recommended for children or lower level recreational goalies (ball hockey).
		    </p>
		    <p>
			    I started with a entry level mask, not knowing much about the different types of equipment. After taking a few hard shots to the face, and playing against better and better opponents, I started to feel less and less safe on the ice. My ears would ring and I started to get headaches after games when I’d take a shot to the head. I opted to purchase a competitive level mask, and the difference has been night and day. Shots that before would have knocked me out of a game or made my next few days hazy are now easily absorbed and shrugged off by the helmet. No more ringing ears or headaches. If you are a perspective buyer and wondering whether you should go with an entry level or a competitive level…always go with the competitive option. You only get one head.

	        <h2>Skates</h2>
            <figure>
                <img src="media/goalie-skates.jpg">
                <figcaption>Goaltender skates. Note the longer blade.</figcaption>
            </figure>
	        <p>Goaltenders wear a different skate than players; they have longer and flatter runners (blades) than player skates for better stability and horizontal movement, and the boots are lighter to allow for flexible ankle movement. They do have extra plastic around the base of the foot called Cowling to protect the parts of the foot that aren’t protected by the leg pads. 
		        
	        </p>
	        <p>
		        The sizing system for the boots is similar to that of the player skates: 1 to 1.5 sizes down from running shoe sizes. For example I wear a 8.5 to 9 shoe, so I look for something around a 7 when I look at skates. Boot widths are similar as well. There is the standard D width, E for wide and EE for extra wide. When fitting the boot, it’s important to not have your toes touching the front of the boot, since taking a shot to the toe, even with cowling, is not enjoyable. Somewhere between 1/8 to 1/4 of an inch is the range you’re looking for.  
	        </p>
	        <p>
		        I personally started with an old pair of Graf goalie skates that I snagged for $50. For a pair of first skates they did an amazing job; they were broken in, well-tested and had enough support to get me through my introduction to the position. Eventually though, it was time to upgrade. I bought a pair of CCM 42k’s that were lighter and had low cowling. This allowed me to more effectively play a butterfly style of goaltending, which was difficult on the Grafs with more cowling.

        <div class="div_top-space" id="legpad">
	        <h2>Leg Pads</h2>
	        <p>The modern leg pad is usually the most expensive piece of equipment a goaltender will buy in their kit. They are what goaltenders where to protect their legs from anything coming their way on the ice, from pucks to sticks and skates. Goaltender preference and style of play are a huge factor when it comes to leg pads, from the number of rolls and breakpoints where a pad will bend, down to the number of straps and positioning of the internal foam pieces for leg protection.
		        
	        </p>
	        <p>
		        Let’s start with the type of pad a goaltender will wear. There are two types of pads, butterfly and hybrid; both come with their own advantages that tailor to the wearers playing style. The first question to ask is what type of player you are: are you truly a butterfly goaltender, focusing on technique and positioning, or do you use more athleticism and reaction when you make saves?
	        </p>
	        <p>
		        Butterfly style pads have flat surfaces, are stiffer, have increased knee cushioning, and are designed to maintain more pad contact with the ice. Hybrid pads have a much more flexible service and are angled towards the top of the pad to allow for more agile movement. This isn't to say that hybrid goaltenders shouldn't wear butterfly style pads or vice-versa, but to point out that they are designed to maximize certain aspects of your play style.
	        </p>
            <figure>

                <figcaption>Butterfly pads on the left, Hybrid pads on the right.</figcaption>
            </figure>
	        <p>Construction materials are where you see your monetary differences between different sets of pads. More expensive pads will often contain proprietary foam and insulation materials and have multiple layers of each, where cheaper entry level and competitive level pads will either have natural materials or only one layer of material.</p>
	        <p>
		        Strapping systems are where a lot of customization happens for pro and competitive level gear. Most high quality gear uses leather straps and metal buckles, with goaltenders sighting durability, fit, and comfort for their choice over using Nylon straps and "Alligator" clips, though some goaltenders do prefer the convenience of them.
	        </p>
	        <p>
		        The leather used on the outer shell of padding is synthetic, which is lighter and more cost-effective than genuine leather and is also more durable and less likely to maintain moisture that could wear down the outer shell over time. Look for this material over others such as heavy gauge nylon or Cordura, since those materials are used for street and ball hockey and will not stand up well to the rigors of ice hockey.
	        </p>
	        <p>
		        Sizing of leg pads is a preference for most goaltenders, but general rule for sizing is (skate-size + ankle-to-knee + knee to wherever you want your pads to stop). All manufacturers have different sizing systems and some goalies like pads that may be "smaller" or "larger" than their calculated fit.

	        <p>
	        	Chest protectors are pretty self explanatory. They cover the entirety of the goaltender's torso, as well as their arms. They are built using various types of foam in numerous segments depending on the upper body area. </p><p>Higher quality protectors will of course have more strategic layers and segmentation of padding than lower quality protectors. Higher quality protectors will also, of course, have more options for making adjustments and provide better body coverage overall, but even low level protectors should cover a minimum area of your full arm from shoulder to wrist; neck to hips, overlapping with your pants, and all the way around both sides of your rib cage.

	        <h2>Catcher</h2>
	        <p>
		        Catchers, otherwise called trappers or simply, gloves, are worn on the "catching" hand of a goaltender to protect the hand as well as cover and catch pucks to defend the net. There are two key features of a catcher: the binding and the web. 
	        </p>
	        <p>
		        Binding is the solid piece of foam that protects the wrist, arm, and hand from the puck. The foam is either bound to the glove as its own  piece, or "binding-less" where it is seamlessly integrated into the glove. Binding helps guide the puck into the webbing while "binding-less" gloves have a larger overall blocking surface.
	        </p>

            </figure>
	        <p>
		        Webbing can be either "Single-T" or "Double-T". The T refers to the piece of material that supports the webbing of the glove. "Single-T" gloves have less webbing, making it easier for goaltenders to drop the puck from their glove, while "Double-T"  gloves have more webbing and trap the puck more effectively.

                <figcaption>The Blocker</figcaption>
            </figure>
	        <p>Blockers are worn by goaltenders to protect the stick-wielding hand. They are simple in design as their sole purpose is to protect the stick hand. They are angled forward at the top of the blocker to prevent the puck from deflecting up and over the goaltender after the puck makes contact with the blocker. The angling also helps push the puck low and away from the net. The thickness of the board may vary from level to level, though the preference now is to have heavier boards to soak up more force from incoming pucks, as well as provide the goaltender with better control when attempting to redirect the puck. As with all pieces of equipment, higher end models are crafted with higher quality materials.</p>

        <div class="div_top-space" id="pants">
	        <h2>Pants</h2>
	        <p>Sometimes the puck will make it past your leg pads, catcher, and blocker. Goaltenders never intend to stop the puck with their thighs and hips, but sometimes shots find their way through everything else to make it there. In that scenario, the goaltender needs to have a flexible yet protective piece of equipment protect their knees, thighs, and hips.
		        
	        </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="media/goalie-pants.jpg">
                <figcaption>Goaltender pants</figcaption>
            </figure>
	        <p>
		        Goaltender pants are of course filled with dense foam padding for a comfortable fit, as well as hard plastic inserts that provide protection to the middle area of the body. The level of protection and fit of course depends on the quality of the materials used. Elite goaltenders need more protection, while recreational and semi competitive players may not need the same level of protection as the higher quality gear provides. 
	        </p>
	        <p>
		        Some pants come may come with built in thigh and knee protection, but in most cases those items may have to be purchased separately. If your pants do not come with knee protection, my advise would be to buy a pair of knee and thigh guards. Taking even a 30 to 40 mph shot directly to the knee is not a fun experience and could cause serious harm.
	        </p>
	        <p>
		        The best way to try on goalie pants is to wear them with your leg pads. This way you can check to make sure you aren't exposing areas of your body to shots you're trying to save, as well as general feel and comfort.
