	        <p>High School had no significant impact on my education and in no way influenced my decision to become a programmer. I originally wanted to be a historian, but I hate writing. I switched to computer science because, as my reasoning went, if I spent all day on computers screwing around, I might as well learn how they work.</p>
	        
	        <p>I was a double major and spent most of my time the first four years of school swimming, so I wasn't too focused on my formal education. I did most of my learning in the summers scouring web development books and sites like w3 schools and HTML Dog to learn how the web worked. It wasn't until my 5th year of college, when I was no longer eligible to compete in D3 sports, that I began to focus more on my studies, branch out and do more with my time academically. </p>
	        <p>I was a student advisor on the Computer Science curriculum committee and advised the professors on how we felt about the education we were receiving and where we think we should be focusing our time. I spent my free time as an academic researcher with another professor, and co-authored a paper as an undergrad on the impacts of Information Technology on Small Business Owners. I got to travel around and present that research at two conferences in Massachusetts and South Carolina, so that was fun. </p>
	        <p>To this day I still buy a couple new programming books every few months to stay current on web technologies. Putting in the extra time and effort that I learned to manage in undergrad has continued into my professional life in a positive way, and I hope to never stop learning. </p>
