	        <p>I used to swim. A lot. Almost every day for twelve years. Every year for 12 years I got faster and faster and ended my career with a couple D3 records, and a lot of all-time top 10 performances in Brockport Swimming history.</p>
	        <p> I also played soccer. I picked it up  and became good enough that I played in college. </p>
	        <p>I play a lot of hockey now, I picked up goaltending, a holdover from my soccer days, and I play all over Rochester. I even picked up position skating so now if I want a different workout I just throw on the other pair of skates and take some shots. You don't have to be crazy to be a goaltender, but it definitely helps.</p>
	        <p>I also enjoy being outside and hiking. Exploring the outdoors is a lot of fun, whether by yourself or with friends (but definitely more with friends). There is a lot of great stuff within an hour or so radius of Rochester that I encourage you to explore. </p>
