	        Positioning is a key aspect to the position of Goaltender. Most of the saves goaltenders make, 
	        as well as some of the goals they don't stop, can all be attributed to the positioning of the 
	        goaltender when the shot was taken. 
        </p>
        <p>
	        The first rule of goaltending is to always be looking at the puck. Always. Track it everywhere. 
	        It sounds simple, but you'd be surprised at how often goaltenders are distracted, caught off guard, 
	        or screened (having their view obstructed). Staying "Square" to the puck using small, precise skate 
	        pushes gives you a greater chance of making an easy save. It is much more difficult to make a save 
	        moving side-to-side or off-center than being "square" and ready for a shot.
        </p>

        <p>
	        The second rule is to know your angles; being "square" to the puck is important, but depending on 
	        how deep you stand in your net, you may still leave a large portion of the net open for shots. 
	        Goaltenders who come far out of their net to square up to a puck and "cut down the angle" are 
	        considered "aggressive" while goaltenders who sit deeper in their net are considered "conservative". 
	        These styles of play have their positives and negatives. 
        </p>
        <p>
	        Aggressive goaltenders can cut down angles and show less net to a shooter, but may leave a large 
	        portion of the net open behind them. The potential shooter may then opt to pass around the goaltender 
	        and force him or her off balance to make a more difficult save. 
        </p>

        <p>
	        Conservative goaltenders will opt to play deeper in their crease around the net, allowing them more 
	        time to react to a play and make the proper save selection in case of redirects or quick passing.
